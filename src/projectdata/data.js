This project is a social media network that lets users follow other users, upload their content, and like other post. The main objective of this project was to create a user-friendly and engaging social media platform that facilitates community building and content sharing among users with similar interests. As the developer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the user interface using React. I also integrate RESTful APIs and ensure seamless data flow between the client and server. Implementing login and logout functionality was one of the main obstacles, which I overcame by using jwt tokens. Using Redux, I also maintained the status of the post and the profile.',

One of the main challenges was ensuring secure payment processing and  I addressed this by integrating Stripe for secure payment transactions',

        info:'The goal is to determine if two sentences are semantically equivalent. This is a common problem in NLP known as sentence similarity or semantic textual similarity (STS). To solve this problem, I used the Quora Question Pairs dataset that is available in Kagle. Then I clean and preprocess, for example, the text. Remove punctuation, tokenize the sentences, and remove the stop word to make it suitable for modeling. I used the Random Forest Classifier model that is available on Skitlearn for prediction and got an accuracy score of 75 percent. I use Streamlit for developing the user interface.',
